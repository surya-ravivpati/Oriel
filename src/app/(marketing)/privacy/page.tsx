          <li><b>Documents:</b> the resume and job description you provide, so the interviewer asks relevant questions. We extract only what is written.</li>
          <li><b>Interview:</b> what you say (transcribed), the interviewer&apos;s questions, timing, and (if you allow recording) an encrypted recording for Playback.</li>
          <li><b>Delivery signals:</b> from audio, loudness and pitch timelines (for pace, pauses and vocal variety); from the camera, if you allow it, estimates of where your head and eyes point and how your upper body moves.</li>

        <p>Some laws (for example Illinois&apos; Biometric Information Privacy Act, Texas&apos; CUBI, and Washington&apos;s biometric law) regulate face geometry and voiceprints. We designed Oriel to avoid collecting them:</p>
        <ul className="mt-3 list-disc space-y-2 pl-5">
          <li><b>Face geometry:</b> the face and pose models run in your browser. Landmarks are reduced each frame to a handful of numbers (such as &ldquo;facing the lens: 0.8&rdquo;) and discarded. We do not create or store face templates and cannot identify you from what we keep.</li>
          <li><b>Voice:</b> we analyze loudness, pitch movement and timing, and transcribe your words. We do not create or store voiceprints and do not identify speakers.</li>
          <li><b>Written release:</b> before any camera-derived signal is computed, we ask for your electronic signature on this release, and record the exact wording, its version and the time:</li>

          <li><b>Opt out any time:</b> switch off camera-based signals, gaze, or posture in Privacy settings. Withdrawing deletes the stored camera-derived timelines. You can still practice.</li>
